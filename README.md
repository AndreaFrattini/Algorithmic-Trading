# Algorithmic-Trading

This is my Master Degree's thesis, which constists in creating a new financial technical indicator based on alternative data and a machine learning models (XGBoost and LighGBM), that is embedded within an algorithm that applies such model in a "rolling" way. In this way, the "Trend Indicator" is able to predict a stockâ€™s price trend of tomorrow with a 53% accuracy, becoming more and more reliable every day as the history on which it can train increases. After the implementation of such indicator, it is also validated through its use in an algorithmic trading strategy that obtains profits in 67% of the time.
